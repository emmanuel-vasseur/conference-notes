# Type-Level TypeScript Workshop (ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§)

by @flegall and @gvergnaud

**Welcome to the Type Level TypeScript Workshop!**

In this course and workshop we hope to take your TypeScript skills from intermediate to **advanced**, and even make a real **TypeScript Wizard** of you! We will start by demonstrating that the type system of TypeScript is much more than simple type annotations: it's actually a full fledged **programming language** in itself! Once you know how to program with types, everything becomes possible. You will no longer feel like your ability to write the abstractions you need is restrained by the type system.

Types are great for many reasons. They **document** the APIs you create, They make developers more **proficient** by providing them smart suggestions as they type and by catching mistakes and typos. The more the type system knows about your code, the better it is at helping you!

Knowing how to write type-level algorithms helps us capture more of the **invariants** of our code in their types, so that the type-checker is able to catch more errors before they reach real users in productions.

In order to get there we first need to aknowledge that the type system of TypeScript is a **real** and **unique** programming language. It's worth starting by learning its fundamentals, just like we would do if we were learning any other programming language. To avoid the confusion between the whole TypeScript language (values and types), and the language of its type system (only types), we will call the latter **Type Level TypeScript** (or **TLTS** for short).

Throughout this course and workshop, we will try to show you the correspondence between the programming concepts you already know like **code branching**, **variable assignment**, **loops** and basic **data structures**, and their type-level equivalent. By assembling those building blocks, we will teach you how to create (large and small) **algorithms** to make sure the code abstractions you create are used as they should be.

It's worth noting that this course isn't a collection of TypeScript tricks! Instead this tries to be a comprehensive course to give you a better understanding of the **fundamentals of the type-level language**. I believe this approach is more empowering because it will help you **solve problems** we **haven't covered** in this course, just by putting the mental model you built to work. Knowing a few tricks can only get you so far, but mastering the building blocks of the language and the way they interact is what will enable you to solve real-world problems.

Finally, we will also see that moving more of the complexity of your code to the type level is a **trade-off** that isn't always worth taking. We will talk about compile time performance, type errors, type-level debugging and other downsides of type level programming. We hope this will help you reflect and take the right decision when using these techniques.

## Note on naming conventions

While it's very common to use upper-case single letters for generics because it works well for simple types: `Array<T>`, it doesn't read very well when types become more complex.

In this workshop we will be using these naming conventions instead:

- Generics should use TitleCase: `type List<a> = ...`
- Type parameters should use camelCase: `type List<first, restOfTheList> = ...`
- Inferred types (local variables), should use camelCase as well: `type GetName<input> = input extends { name: infer name } ? ...`
